The goal of the work is to help people to make educated choices, e.g., about health and environmental issues, by writing short articles for media ranging from the newspaper to the website of an NGO.", "title": "Calderwood Seminar in Public Writing: Biology in the News", "notes": "None assigned", "prereq": "Any two BISC 200-level courses; juniors and seniors only.", "xlisted": "None assigned", "by_permission": "None assigned", "dept": "Biological Sciences", "credit_hours": "1", "dists": [6, 16, 15], "addit_info": "None assigned"}}, {"pk": 112, "model": "courses.course", "fields": {"code": "BISC347", "description": "This course meets along with ES 247/BISC 247 and offers an opportunity for students to engage more deeply with the material and perform independent research.
