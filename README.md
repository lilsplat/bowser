Wellesley Bowser
======

Bowser provides a one-stop service where Wellesley students can check their degree requirements, shop for courses, and read or write reviews about classes and professors. We aim to provide a solution for the scattered nature of planning your Wellesley career as it stands - information in terms of what you need to graduate, courses, and how you as an individual stand in your degree progress are all inconveniently located and must be separately found.

Bowser aims to make Wellesley scheduling simple by providing useful information about courses and how they fit into a student's academic plan. Services that Bowser would provide include a course browser (similar to the one provided by the college), a community to read and write course and professor reviews, the ability to create an individual student profile that lets a student enter their past courses and dynamically display their degree progress, and a built in calendar function that helps a student visualize their upcoming semester when choosing classes. 

Bowser is created by Lily Xie (creator, backend), Sravanti Tekumalla (backend, frontend), and Leigh Morrison (designer). Bowser was created using Django, SQLite, and Scrapy.
