sick wellesley course browser ish

===========================
LX 6/7/14
Added current working directories
Includes:
/course_browser_database 
  holds the .txt files containing course information. Every semester will be in a different document. ATM they're named according to the codes each semester was assigned on the website, and I'll change that later. You'll see there's only one in there right now - I'm still working out some bugs with reading from lists generated by scrapy. It's unhappy reading a "\x" character I think..

/course_browser_htmls 
  holds the course catalog html code specific to every semester, pulled from the course browser. This is for generating the database files, so you dont need to worry about these.

html_sucker_script.py 
  written to help grab the html from the course catalog. it's like 5 lines of code but boy was it a pain to figure out.

/spiders 
  contains the scrapy spiders that crawl the web. these are actually crawling the html docs in course_browser_htmls. course_spider craws these grabbing course info and saving it to txt docs - course_spider.py is where I'm having the list bugs if you wanna take a look. :)
