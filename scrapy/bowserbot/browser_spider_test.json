Womanism is a social change perspective rooted in Black women's and other women of color's everyday experiences and everyday methods of problem solving in everyday spaces, extended to the problem of ending all forms of oppression for all people, restoring the balance between people and the environment/nature, and reconciling human life with the spiritual dimension. (Phillips, The Womanist Reader, p. xx).� We examine the origins of contemporary womanism in the works of Alice Walker, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, Clenora Hudson-Weems, and others whose work has influenced contemporary womanism.  We consider how African women’s cosmology and history have impacted the evolution and expression of womanism in the New World, giving womanism a different platform than other critical theories rooted in Western/European frames of reference and linking womanism to transnational indigenous and “fourth world” perspectives.  Through diverse case studies, we explore womanist methodology, praxis, and activism, and engage questions of how womanism differs from other critical theories and social movement modalities. Finally, we examine the womanist social vision and womanist notions of community, including human, ecological/environmental, and cosmic.",

The ultimate goal of the course is to find ways of adequately imagining and imaging various identities today. We will discuss socio-political discourses, including essentialism, structuralism, postmodernism, and post-colonialism and we will question the validity of such concepts as diaspora, nationalism, transnationalism and identity in an era of global politics that celebrates the hybrid self.,",

Are episodes and regimes of racial injustice the result of economic structure or a shameful absence of political will?

In contrast, this course seeks to bridge Islamic art and social history, in order to uncover the dynamics between objects and users or viewers in specific social settings. We will look at the use of early Islamic monuments as stages for religious and political spectacles, at the exchange of portable objects designed as gifts and commodities around the Mediterranean, at the female patronage of religious buildings, among other things.",

The influences of early European contact, the Middle Passage, colonialism, and postcolonialism have affected art production and modes of representation in Africa and the African Diaspora for centuries. Documentary and commercial films will assist in framing these representations. The study of contemporary art and artists throughout the African Diaspora will allow for a particularly intriguing examination of postmodern constructions of African identity.",

Taught in a hands-on/workshop format, students will carry out an experimental test of relativity, as well as computational analyses which reveal that the Universe's expansion is accelerating and that 80% of the matter in the Universe is fundamentally different from all known particles in the Standard Model of particle physics.  We will also discuss the ongoing experimental search for the elusive dark matter particle, as well as efforts to understand the nature of dark energy. No prior physics background is assumed.�We will make use of high school algebra and geometry in our work.�Not to be counted toward the minimum physics major or to fulfill the physics entrance requirement for medical school.",

Along the way, we zoom in to specific concepts and processes that help us understand overall patterns. Laboratories will primarily be taught in the field and greenhouses and will include plant identification, observational and experimental studies, and long-term study of forest communities on the Wellesley campus. Laboratories will also include aspects of experimental design and data analysis.

How did snakes get to be so long? How did humans evolve? The field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo, integrates the long-separate fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology to answer these questions. In this course, we will explore topics such as the evolution of novelties, body plan evolution, developmental constraints, convergent evolution, and the role of environmental changes in evolution. Through reading of original papers, we will examine recent advances made in evo-devo and critically analyze the role of evo-devo in biology and the implications beyond biology. Students will have the opportunity to design and conduct an independent research project using arthropods.",

Along the way, we zoom in to specific concepts and processes that help us understand overall patterns. Laboratories will primarily be taught in the field and greenhouses and will include plant identification, observational and experimental studies, and long-term study of forest communities on the Wellesley campus. Laboratories will also include aspects of experimental design and data analysis. The goal of the course is not only to train students in botany and plant ecology, but to engage them in the world of plants every time they step outside.",

How did snakes get to be so long? How did humans evolve? The field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo, integrates the long-separate fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology to answer these questions. In this course, we will explore topics such as the evolution of novelties, body plan evolution, developmental constraints, convergent evolution, and the role of environmental changes in evolution. Through reading of original papers, we will examine recent advances made in evo-devo and critically analyze the role of evo-devo in biology and the implications beyond biology. Students will have the opportunity to design and conduct an independent research project using arthropods.",

The goal of this writing-intensive seminar is to synthesize knowledge from a wide range of biological disciplines and to learn how to communicate important biological concepts to a broad audience. Students will review articles from the primary literature, decide which findings are relevant, and work on making the information and the scientific process transparent, accessible, and interesting to non-experts. The goal of the work is to help people to make educated choices, e.g., about health and environmental issues, by writing short articles for media ranging from the newspaper to the website of an NGO.",

From the Anglicizing of names to the erasure of racial backgrounds, the ways in which Chican@s and Latin@s are represented has been contingent on ideologies of race, gender, class and sexuality. We will be examining how films have typecast Chicanas/Latinas as criminals or as exotic based on their status as women of color, and how Chicano/Latino filmmakers continue the practice of casting Chicanas/Latinas solely as supporting characters to male protagonists.",

We examine the worldwide emergence and energy of new cinemas during the epochal changes brought about by sexual and cultural revolutions, postcolonialism, and multiculturalism. Against the background of a shifting world order and technological transformations affecting how films are made, distributed, and viewed, we shall explore the vexed question of art cinema's implicit opposition to the ethos of fast consumption, asking ourselves: whither cinema after its hundredth anniversary?",

Struggles such as these gather their meanings through anecdote, like the transmutation of Brooklyn’s Stanley Kubrick into an English director; the converse movement of Alfred Hitchcock to Hollywood; and the often self-parodied “use” of Hollywood by British writers like Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Graham Greene, W.H.

      "description": "Glitch-core, bit-crushing, circuit bending, hardware hacking, tape splicing, record scratching—in response to the hegemony of laptops among contemporary composers, many sound artists are now turning for musical expressivity to electronic objects thought to be long-obsolete: the beat-up synthesizer, the rewired amplifier, the Speak & Spell toy, the 8-bit Nintendo system. In this course we will investigate this trend by looking backwards, towards the histories of these objects and their relationship to the earliest forms of electronic music.  In addition to developing a rigorous understanding of the history of electronic music through the parallel technological adolescences of other electronics, we will also learn to build electronic music-making machines of our own, using largely analog and outmoded technologies, as well as emulating the sounds of the past using present-day digital materials, including Arduino microprocessors, speaker cones, transducers, and 3D printers.",

We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works; the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation; and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate ethnographic film within the larger project for representing culture, addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices, including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, and documentary film.

In each case, we will examine the form within its original cultural milieu, then trace its entry into English and subsequent development in modern English and contemporary American poetry.  Some of the questions we will ask include: How do poetic forms reflect and respond to the cultural landscape in which they developed?  How does the meaning and use of a form evolve when it enters a new culture?  What are some of the technical difficulties inherent in adapting a form into a new language?  To what extent do poetic forms come freighted with the histories from which they arose?  Some of the forms to be discussed include: Ode (Greece), Funeral Elegy (Greece), Epigram (Rome), Love Elegy (Rome), Sestina (Italy), Pantoum (Malaysia) Ghazal (Indo-Persian-Arabic), Haiku and Renga (Japan).",

We will study the assigned texts from three points of view: as individual works of literary art, as rising out of a specific cultural context, and as works that have escaped that original context into other languages and ages. Noting how some meanings are lost in translation and others gained, students will develop a mode of reading and a critical vocabulary. The required readings will likely be drawn from the following works:,Taught primarily in lecture and not writing-intensive.",

The course focuses on Middle English language and poetics as well as medieval structures of community—political, cultural, religious, and economic.

In their final application, the sentences of that language have performative power. Imaginative literature, in turn, has embodied critical depictions of the law in the lives of individuals and societies.  Although literature lacks the law’s power to punish, its cultural power is nevertheless undeniable. In our course, we will examine texts from classical Greek to 20th century literature in order to trace and also question the ways in which issues of law and justice have been treated in dramatic and narrative literature.",

Struggles such as these gather their meanings through anecdote, like the transmutation of Brooklyn’s Stanley Kubrick into an English director; the converse movement of Alfred Hitchcock to Hollywood; and the often self-parodied “use” of Hollywood by British writers like Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Graham Greene, W.H.

Culturally, this region is home to diverse human communities including 600 indigenous groups. Economically, many countries in Latin America depend upon the export of natural resources and agricultural products. Growing populations, increased global trade, and a complicated history of colonization put pressure on all of these areas, creating a fascinating and important backdrop for exploring issues in food systems and the environment. Topics will be guided by student interest, but may include food justice, agroecology, water rights, biodiversity conservation, biopiracy, transnational agreements, farmer networks and social movements.",

(If “adventure” means “what must happen,” how can you be a hero when your heroism is contingent on circumstances?) We’ll consider this and other issues in adventure novels from the French and English traditions, concentrating on tales of castaways (Robinson Crusoe and his French counterparts), yarns of the sea, stories of solitary heroes who escape the law (Jean Valjean in,).

Olympe wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Women and campaigned for the right of women to divorce, and in her play,she argues against slavery. George Sand, influenced by socialist ideas, writes novels and plays that question the social norms and gender roles imposed on women by the conservative society of the 19th century. We will discuss these two writers’ opposition to revolutionary violence and reflect on the ways in which their voices were ultimately silenced: Olympe decapitated by the guillotine, Sand marginalized as the Bonne Dame de Nohant, the author merely of rustic novels.",

No emblem of the era is as iconic as the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the World’s Fair of 1889 as a tribute to French technology and progress. During the years preceding World War I, Paris was the center of the European avant-garde—indeed, the capital of modernity. While cultural ebullience is its hallmark, this period also witnessed the definitive establishment of a republican regime, the expansion of an overseas empire, and the integration of the countryside into national life. Drawing on historical documents and literary texts as well as films, posters, and songs, this interdisciplinary course examines French culture, politics, and society during the era that ushered France into the modern age.",

Imaginative literature, in turn, has embodied critical depictions of the law in the lives of individuals and societies.  Although literature lacks the law’s power to punish, its cultural power is nevertheless undeniable. In our course, we will examine texts from classical Greek to 20th century literature in order to trace and also question the ways in which issues of law and justice have been treated in dramatic and narrative literature.",

Authors include various Scottish luminaries and some of their English and continental contemporaries (Mandeville, Hume, Ferguson, and Smith himself, among others) whose texts illuminate a range of Enlightenment themes: conflict over Christian theology; speculation about the origins of human society; the birth of aesthetic theory amidst controversy about the social importance of the arts; new formulations of republican political ideals; and the emergence of the study of political economy and economic development.",

We will begin by looking at differing theories of the city: Was it a place of freedom or increased control, especially for socially marginalized groups like women, colonized populations, and the poor? Was it an artifact of dominant social forces or a space for individual self-creation? Themes we will cover include colonial urbanism, modernism, fascist city planning, suburbanization, tourism, migration, and reclamations of urban space by social movements, squatters, and youth subcultures.",

Regimes of nationalism, socialism, fascism, and capitalism each provided prescriptive models of good and healthy gender relationships, making sexuality the frequent and ongoing site for state and scientific intervention. At the same time, the ruptures of two world wars and the effects of modernization created spaces for unprecedented challenges to sexual mores from below. This course explores the fraught, and occasionally deadly, debates over sexual normalcy in twentieth-century Europe through the topics of eugenics, psychoanalysis, first- and second-wave feminism, the sexual politics of fascism, and the rise of the permissive society.",

In this seminar we will explore what race means in the United States by examining the varied ways that it has shaped—and was shaped by—key moments in nineteenth century American history. Topics covered will include: slavery, the conquest of the American West, immigration, citizenship and the nation-state, Social Darwinism, the Great Migration, and American imperialism. Throughout the course we will seek to understand race in the United States by exploring the following questions: What is race? If it is but a concept or idea, how and why has it affected so many lives and dictated so much of our past?",

We will look at the various strategies they used to challenge the status quo and to protect, promote, and express themselves. We will also examine resistance to their efforts to do so, and how these contests shaped U.S. culture. Throughout, we will pay close attention to the formation and structure of political, economic, and social inequity.

And how ruins, as physical artifacts, became central in the creation of the modern (a future) Spanish World. The Spanish Philippines will be a test case for understanding the place of classical antiquity in American and Spanish European modernity.",

Though such violence is often labeled ethnic or religious, its causes are much broader. A conceptual unbundling of causal strands (diachronic and synchronic) can bring into focus different ways of dealing with the legacy of violence. Readings will also focus on local and international (humanitarian, legal, cultural, and military) interventions to end such conflicts, as well as approaches to post-conflict reconstruction.

How did Nehru's understanding of world history structure his program of industrialization? How did Ambedkar's untouchable upbringing shape his agenda? Could Gandhi's nonviolent agenda be sustained? Could an India based on individual transformation also annihilate caste?

It also exposes students to some of the political mysteries that have characterized Italy since the end of World War II and which have become the subject of much contemporary mystery writing, films, and documentaries. From an aesthetic standpoint, we will ask why a new generation of young writers has been drawn to these mysteries as subjects of their writings and examine the variety of narrative forms they use to investigate them. Authors to be studied will include Carlo Emilio Gadda, Umberto Eco, Carlo Luccarelli, Dario Fo, Simone Sarasso, Giuseppe Genna, and the writing collectives known as Luther Blisset and Wu Ming.",

With a foundation in African American genres (especially blues and gospel), popular music has also absorbed strong influences from rural white Protestant communities, Latin America, and Europe, and its sounds are indelibly linked to twentieth-century technologies (the electric guitar, multitrack recording, turntables). With an emphasis on the 1940s to the 1970s, our historical survey of American popular music will bring us from the 1800s to the present day. Using close listening as a starting point, we will learn how to decode sounds to reveal their complex social histories as we assess popular music's role in America's tumultuous twentieth century.",

In this course we will investigate this trend by looking backwards, towards the histories of these objects and their relationship to the earliest forms of electronic music.  In addition to developing a rigorous understanding of the history of electronic music through the parallel technological adolescences of other electronics, we will also learn to build electronic music-making machines of our own, using largely analog and outmoded technologies, as well as emulating the sounds of the past using present-day digital materials, including Arduino microprocessors, speaker cones, transducers, and 3D printers.",

And, why are friends valuable? Drawing examples from literature and films, we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. Many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake; we will consider whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. We'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. Finally, we will compare the love that characterizes friendship with the feelings that sustain relationships with parents, children, and lovers. ",

Furthermore, nothing is inherently valuable: an object or action is valuable only because you choose to value it.  This class will explore the ethical consequences of this insight: is it possible to derive a moral standard within this framework, or is an existentialist bound to be a nihilist?  If the source of value is each person's free choice, what happens when people disagree?  Can we praise or blame other people for their actions?  The works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche, Simone de Beauvoir, and Soren Kierkegaard are among those studied.",

Taught in a hands-on/workshop format, students will carry out an experimental test of relativity, as well as computational analyses which reveal that the Universe expansion is accelerating and that 80% of the matter in the Universe is fundamentally different from all known particles in the Standard Model of particle physics.  We will also discuss the ongoing experimental search for the elusive dark matter particle, as well as efforts to understand the nature of dark energy. No prior physics background is assumed. We will make use of high school algebra and geometry in our work.�Not to be counted toward the minimum physics major or to fulfill the physics entrance requirement for medical school.",

Unleashing one of the great revolutions of the twentieth century in 1910, the revolutionaries and their heirs then ruled Mexico for 71 years. Developing a genuine multiparty political system only since 2000, Mexico's democracy now faces an array of daunting challenges, including the increasing power of drug cartels whose tactics of violence and intimidation threaten the entire nation. Our seminar will aim to make sense out of the fascinating puzzle that is Mexico. We will focus on its twentieth-century Revolution, its distinctive political system (including the return to power of the PRI in 2013), and its current social, economic, and political challenges. We will examine its complex relationship with the United States, emphasizing the dual issues of immigration and drugs.",

Drawing on the literature of environmental politics and policy, this course will consider how environmental issues are framed in political discourse, various approaches to environmental advocacy and reform, and the contested role of science in environmental politics. The course will be organized around environmental case studies, including endangered species conservation, public lands management, air and water pollution, and toxics regulation. ",

      "description": "We often think of warfare in conventional terms: states fight other states in large-scale battles employing uniformed soldiers to conquer enemy territory. In reality, however, there are many instances of asymmetric conflicts involving non-state actors who avoid open battles, whose fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, and who seek a wide variety of political objectives. Peasant revolts, communist insurrections, ethnic rebellions, and terrorist movements are among the various ways in which the weak have attempted to use violence to break the will of the strong. We address these wars from a theoretical, historical, and contemporary perspective. We will explore how classical theorists, including Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, adapted the ideas of Clausewitz to guerilla warfare. We will examine how rebel groups—whether the Spanish guerillas, Boer commandos, Chinese communists, or Serb militias—employed violence to intimidate their opponents. We will consider how globalization and the diffusion of military technology have transformed guerilla conflicts, and debate the implications of our theories for contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.",

How, then, can cooperative and selfless behaviors be explained? In this course evidence and theories from the psychological, economic, and neurobiological literatures will be examined.

Students will learn about the factors that influence this phenomenon of 'childhood amnesia' and the course of autobiographical memory development in children. The topic of language features heavily in this course, as language and autobiographical memory are inextricably linked. We will discuss how the language that parents use to reminisce with children influences autobiographical memory development. Additional topics include: language, autobiographical memory and gender, broader societal and cultural influences on memory, atypical language development and its effect on autobiographical memory, and bilingualism and autobiographical memory.",

And why are some people only average (or even below average) in these areas? We will critically evaluate a broad range of perceptual and cognitive abilities (and disabilities) by drawing upon the fields of cognitive neuroscience, behavioral genetics, development, and human variation. We will address three kinds of question: What broad combination of nature and nurture, and what specific genes and experiences, contribute to differing abilities? What are the neural and cognitive bases of such abilities? And how can we or should we apply such knowledge to ourselves, our families, our communities, and our countries?",

Additionally, it  aims to examine how the various religious traditions of South Asia respond to aspirations and struggles as women. Passages from sacred texts, women’s own writings, historical accounts, video clips of women’s rites, and films will provide the sources for our exploration.",

Our discussions analyze the actions of those institutions involved either in calling public attention to or distracting public attention away from particular problems in our society. This focus enables students to acquire a perspective toward social problems that they are unlikely to gain from the many other forums where people discuss social problems, such as journalism or politics.",

Specific topics to be covered include the historical development of childhood as a distinct phase of life, children’s peer cultures, children and work, children’s use of public spaces, and the effects of consumer culture upon children.

They will listen to music and examine videos illustrating experiences of Spanish language learners in the United States and abroad. By the end of the semester, students will gain an understanding of how their culture influences their language learning and how their language learning affects their perspective of Latino/Hispanic culture.

It is divided into three sections: frames and contexts, reproductive issues and debates, and women’s agency, social movements and global policy. Readings will problematize the multiple dimensions of reproductive politics and the social hierarchies that are produced, resisted, and transformed in the practice of reproductive lives.",

We focus on three major areas: (1) the medicalization of bodies (such as abortion and infertility); (2) the discipline of bodies (cosmetic surgery, fitness); and (3) the use of the body as a vehicle for performance, self-expression, and identity (drag queens, fashion, sports).

To understand the changes that have occurred in the representation of Chican@s/Latin@s, this course proposes an analysis of films that traces various stereotypes to examine how those images have been perpetuated, altered, and ultimately resisted. From the Anglicizing of names to the erasure of racial backgrounds, the ways in which Chican@s and Latin@s are represented has been contingent on ideologies of race, gender, class, and sexuality. We will be examining how films have typecast Chicanas/Latinas as criminals or as exotic based on their status as women of color, and how Chicano/Latino filmmakers continue the practice of casting Chicanas/Latinas solely as supporting characters to male protagonists.",

We take a relational approach that highlights historical and transnational linkages between sociocultural, political, and economic structures that construct sexuality in different locations. Through applying micro and macro methods, we interrogate binaries such as modern/traditional, secular/religious, West/East, and challenge the mainstream representations of sexuality in the Muslim and Arab worlds.",

With a grasp of these analytical tools and issues, we move on to examine the formation of transnational women's movements that have mobilized around women's human rights. In the last part of the course, we will see why and how sex trafficking has become the convergent point of feminist debates, and consider the policy implications these differences and politics are having on the lives of women around the world.",

What shots and frame compositions tempt filmmakers to imitation and homage? What narrative themes seduce critics? What paradoxes puzzle scholars and writers? To what extent is Hitchcock the master of his own films—in the words of film theorists, an auteur as much as a director? To what extent did he collaborate with others—screenwriters, composers, actors, cinematographers, and yes, his own wife and daughter—to produce enduring works of art? In reading, viewing, analyzing, and writing about films from all periods of Hitchcock's working life, this course will use these questions to shape our understanding of film and film theory.",

      "description": "From their legendary ability to stay thin, to their shrewd mothering skills, sophisticated charm, culinary prowess, and sexual savoir-faire, les Françaises—French women—have long held American commentators in thrall. We will explore the complexity of twenty-first century portrayals of French women as models of a unique vein of femininity. We will explore how writers construct their images of French women from three directions: through close readings, critiques of authorial voice, and the analysis of supporting evidence. We will investigate portrayals of la Française in self-help books, memoirs, feminist manifestos, film, fiction, and historical accounts. Participants will analyze, then imitate the texts we consider, paying close attention to how the choice of a particular genre sheds light on the author’s development of his or her thesis.",

This course is a comparative study of illness and therapy, in both its historical and cultural contexts. As a phenomenon of nature, the outbreak and spread of disease allows us to examine people's intimate and changing relationship with their physical environment. Concurrently, illness is a social phenomenon: how we define, treat, and assess conditions of sickness is shaped by our scientific etiologies, social structures, and cultural traditions. Three major maladies will serve as case studies: the bubonic plague, mental illness, and HIV/AIDS. Our approach will be interdisciplinary, and will explore differing perspectives offered by bio-medicine, anthropology, history, literature, and film",

Population growth propelled a form of economic development that would leave modern legacies of extraordinary political and environmental challenges. Our course investigates these breathtaking changes and critically assesses their legacies for the present. Topics include family life and gender, rulership and territorial expansion in Tibet, environmental transformation, and long-term trends in Western perceptions of China. Assignments emphasize strong analytical writing through interpretation of primary sources, critical thinking about links between past and present, and independent research.
