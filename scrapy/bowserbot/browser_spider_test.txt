Environmental Justice, "Race," and Sustainable Development
1
An investigation of the extent to which the causes and consequences of environmental degradation are influenced by social inequality and the devaluation of indigenous peoples. The course will examine how the poor, indigenous peoples and people of color are subjected to environmental hazards. Topics include the link between negative environmental trends and social inequality; the social ecology of slums, ghettos, and shanty towns; the disproportionate exposure of some groups to pollutants, toxic chemicals, and carcinogens; dumping of hazardous waste in Africa and other Third World countries; and industrial threats to the ecology of small island states in the Caribbean. The course will evaluate Agenda 21, the international program of action from the Earth Summit designed to halt environmental degradation and promote sustainable development.

Caribbean Intellectual Thought in the Twentieth Century
1
During the twentieth century the Anglophone Caribbean produced a rich body of ideas that had an enormous impact upon the colonial and post-colonial worlds. These ideas cover fields such as history, politics, economics and culture. This course traces the development of these ideas, examines their applicability to the specific circumstances in the Caribbean and analyzes how they resonated in the larger world of ideas. We will look at the works of writers and thinkers that could include: A.R.F. Webber, Marcus Garvey, Arthur Lewis, Eric Williams, C.L.R James, Amy Ashwood Garvey, Jamaica Kincaid, Patricia Mohammed, Erna Brodber, Cheddi Jagan, Walter Rodney, Maurice Bishop, and Michael Manley.

Topics in African/African American Art
1
This course charts past and present artistic mediations of racial, ethnic and gendered experiences throughout the world, using  the rubric of the body. In the struggle to understand the relation between self and other, artists have critically engaged with the images that define our common sense of belonging, ranging from a rejection of stereotypes to their appropriations, from the discovery of alternative histories to the rewriting of dominant narratives, from the concepts of difference to theories of diversity. The ultimate goal of the course is to find ways of adequately imagining and imaging various identities today. We will discuss socio-political discourses, including essentialism, structuralism, postmodernism, and post-colonialism and we will question the validity of such concepts as diaspora, nationalism, transnationalism and identity in an era of global politics that celebrates the hybrid self.,

Race, Ethnicity, and Politics in America
1
The  politics of race and ethnicity in America are constantly shifting, due to demographic, political, and economic transformations. However, fundamental questions about the nature of racial and ethnic divisions in America help frame the investigation of race and ethnicity across historical contexts. Some of the questions that will guide our discussions are: Are racial and ethnic hierarchies built into American political life? Are episodes and regimes of racial injustice the result of economic structure or a shameful absence of political will? How do gender and class influence our understandings of racial and ethnic categorization and inequality? To what extent is racial and ethnic identification a matter of personal choice?

Seminar. Advanced Topics in American Studies
1
This course examines Barack Obama, first, as a viable public intellectual who intervenes on discussions of race, religion, and other hot-button topics, and second, as a cultural phenomenon and symbol of significant social import. Students will critically engage Obama's writings and speaking, including his biography, sense of identity, and political philosophy. We will move to the events of his presidential campaign to understand his electoral victory, examining representations of Obama during and after the 2008 and 2012 elections. Instead of only situating President Obama in American history, or giving his supporters a platform to celebrate his ascendance, this seminar will ask students to unpack that ascendancy over the past six years and to engage the broader discourses that make him a political and cultural lightning rod.

History and Theory in Anthropology
1
This course introduces students to contemporary anthropology by tracing its historical development and its specific application in ethnographic writing. It examines the social context in which each selected model or "paradigm" took hold and the extent of cognitive sharing, by either intellectual borrowing or breakthrough. The development of contemporary theory will be examined both as internal to the discipline and as a response to changing intellectual climates and social milieu. The course will focus on each theory in action, as the theoretical principles and methods apply to ethnographic case studies.

This course will examine the evolutionary foundations of human variability. This theme is approached broadly from the perspectives of anatomy, paleontology, genetics, primatology, and ecology. For this purpose, the course will address the principles of human evolution, fossil evidence, behavior, and morphological characteristics of human and nonhuman primates. Explanation of the interrelationships between biological and sociobehavioral aspects of human evolution, such as the changing social role of sex, are discussed. In addition, human inter-population differences and environmental factors that account for these differences will be evaluated.

This course will provide an introduction into the core concepts of population genetics, with special focus on their application to human and nonhuman primate evolution. Population genetics is the branch of evolutionary biology concerned with how genetic variation is patterned within and between populations and how these patterns change over time. Though the theory is applicable to all organisms, specific examples drawn from the human and nonhuman primate literature will be used as case studies. Topics will also include the genetic basis for disease, pedigree analysis, and personal genomics. The course will be structured around lectures and discussion with regular computer labs to provide firsthand experience working with anthropological genetic topics and analyses of genetic data sets.

This seminar explores ethnographic film as a genre for representing "reality," anthropological knowledge and cultural lives. We will examine how ethnographic film emerged in a particular intellectual and political economic context as well as how subsequent conceptual and formal innovations have shaped the genre. We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works; the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation; and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate ethnographic film within the larger project for representing "culture," addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices, including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, and documentary film.

Experimental Ethnography: At the Boundaries of Art and Anthology
1
This course explores the territory of ethnography as it is practiced at the intersection of art and anthropology. Ethnography is a practice of anthropological knowledge production that involves engaging with cultural identity and difference. It raises issues about the relationship between the Self and Other, representation and reality. Although traditionally, ethnographies are written manuscripts, anthropologists are experimenting with ethnographic representation in other media and formats. Artists engaged in conceptual, social and site-specific modes are engaging in parallel ethnographic practices. Through this course, students will be introduced to the history and contemporary efflorescence of these experiments and cross-pollinations.

In addition to the lands of the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, and Cypriots, we will focus especially on the great empires of ancient Assyria (Iraq) and Persia (Iran). Topics will include urban development, palatial architecture, portraiture, representations of empire, cross-cultural connections, early forms of mass media, temples, and votive dedications. We will conclude by considering how Near Eastern antiquities came to be estheticized and politicized in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe and North America.

African Art and the Diaspora: From Ancient Concepts to Postmodern Identities
1
We will investigate the transmission and transformation of African art and culture and their ongoing significant impact on the continent, in Europe, and in the Americas. This course explores the arts of primarily western and central Africa, including the communities of the Bakongo, Yoruba, and Mande, among many others. The influences of early European contact, the Middle Passage, colonialism, and postcolonialism have affected art production and modes of representation in Africa and the African Diaspora for centuries. Documentary and commercial films will assist in framing these representations. The study of contemporary art and artists throughout the African Diaspora will allow for a particularly intriguing examination of postmodern constructions of African identity.

Beginning with Louis XIV's development of Versailles and ending with Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, we will examine works of art in relation to social, political, cultural, and scientific debates of the period. Topics include new ideas of nature and landscape design; medical theory and the representation of the body; spaces of social reform and libertinage; travel and the rediscovery of antiquity; colonialism; and counter-Enlightenment trends. The course combines recent scholarship in art history with readings from the history of science, French and English literature, and cultural studies.

Seminar. Topics in Modern Art
1
The Bauhaus, the school of architecture, art, and design, was founded in Weimar Germany at the end of WWI, closed in the mid-‘30s, and reestablished in Chicago in 1937. A magnet for some of the most remarkable artists and designers of the interwar years, the Bauhaus was the preeminent training ground for modernist design and theory first in Germany, and then in the U.S. and internationally. The class will consider the historical position of the Bauhaus; examine the school's curriculum, philosophy, practices, and faculty; and examine its legacies in recent architecture, photography, design, and painting.

Topics in African/African American Art
1
This course charts past and present artistic mediations of racial, ethnic and gendered experiences throughout the world, using� the rubric of the body. In the struggle to understand the relation between self and other, artists have critically engaged with the images that define our common sense of belonging, ranging from a rejection of stereotypes to their appropriations, from the discovery of alternative histories to the rewriting of dominant narratives, from the concepts of difference to theories of diversity. The ultimate goal of the course is to find ways of adequately imagining and imaging various identities today. We will discuss socio-political discourses, including essentialism, structuralism, postmodernism, and post-colonialism and we will question the validity of such concepts as diaspora, nationalism, transnationalism and identity in an era of global politics that celebrates the hybrid self.

Islamic Art and Architecture, 650-1500
1
The course provides a thematic chronological survey of Islamic art and architecture from their inception around 650 C.E. to the dawn of the modern empires in 1500 C.E. Until recently, most scholarship approached Islamic art through stylistic taxonomies or technical studies of materials. In contrast, this course seeks to bridge Islamic art and social history, in order to uncover the dynamics between objects and users or viewers in specific social settings. We will look at the use of early Islamic monuments as stages for religious and political spectacles, at the exchange of portable objects designed as gifts and commodities around the Mediterranean, at the female patronage of religious buildings, among other things.

Seminar: Topics in the Visual Arts
1
This course explores the territory of ethnography as it is practiced at the intersection of art and anthropology. Ethnography is a practice of anthropological knowledge production that involves engaging with cultural identity and difference. It raises issues about the relationship between the Self and Other, representation and reality. Although traditionally, ethnographies are written manuscripts, anthropologists are experimenting with ethnographic representation in other media and formats. Artists engaged in conceptual, social and site-specific modes are engaging in parallel ethnographic practices. Through this course, students will be introduced to the history and contemporary efflorescence of these experiments and cross-pollinations.

Taught in a hands-on/workshop format, students will carry out an experimental test of relativity, as well as computational analyses which reveal that the Universe's expansion is accelerating and that 80% of the matter in the Universe is fundamentally different from all known particles in the Standard Model of particle physics.  We will also discuss the ongoing experimental search for the elusive dark matter particle, as well as efforts to understand the nature of dark energy. No prior physics background is assumed.�We will make use of high school algebra and geometry in our work.�Not to be counted toward the minimum physics major or to fulfill the physics entrance requirement for medical school.

The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of genetics at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics. Laboratory investigation will expose students to the fundamentals of genetics including classical and molecular techniques for genetic analysis.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will focus on the unique biological properties of stem cells and how these cells might lead to novel patient therapies. Questions to be addressed include: How were stem cells discovered? Where do stem cells come from, and how can they be used to study human diseases? What are the similarities and differences between embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and "induced pluripotent stem cells"? We will also discuss the scientific, bioethical and political controversies associated with recent stem cell discoveries. Promising areas of current research will be described.

Genetics with Laboratory

The goal of the course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of genetics at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The mechanisms that regulate the control of gene expression leading to alteration in phenotype during cellular differential will be studied. A link will be established between the generation of genetic variants through mutation and recombination, their patterns of inheritance, interactions between genes to produce complex phenotypes, and the maintenance of such genetic variation in natural populations. Topics will include: organization of the eukaryotic genome, gene structure and function, multilevel gene control and dysregulation in disease, genetics of pattern formation, inheritance of gene differences, gene and allele interactions, and aspects of population and evolutionary genetics.

The diversity of organismal forms has fascinated human beings for centuries. How did butterflies get eyespots? What is the evolutionary origin of bird feathers? How did snakes get to be so long? How did humans evolve? The field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo, integrates the long-separate fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology to answer these questions. In this course, we will explore topics such as the evolution of novelties, body plan evolution, developmental constraints, convergent evolution, and the role of environmental changes in evolution. Through reading of original papers, we will examine recent advances made in evo-devo and critically analyze the role of evo-devo in biology and the implications beyond biology. Students will have the opportunity to design and conduct an independent research project using arthropods.

Tropical rain forests and coral reefs seem to invite superlatives. They are among the most fascinating, diverse, productive, but also most endangered ecosystems on earth. These topics are addressed during the fall lectures in preparation for the laboratory part of the course, which takes place in Central America during Wintersession. We first travel to a small island, part of an atoll bordering the world's second longest barrier reef off the coast of Belize. In the second half of the field course we explore an intact lowland rain forest in Costa Rica. Laboratory work is carried out primarily outdoors and includes introductions to flora and fauna, and implementation of research projects designed during the fall.

Designs for Life: The Biomechanics of Animals and Plants with Laboratory
0
This course will focus on how organisms cope with a complex physical world. Their sophisticated designs withstand large environmental forces, caused by gravity, wind, and water flow. Animals, as well as confronting the problems of not falling over or apart, must overcome additional challenges associated with locomotion. Biomaterials, including spider silk that is stronger than steel and springy tendons that power prodigious jumps, help make this possible. Topics for discussion will include how biomaterials give organisms structure and strength, how muscle acts as a biological motor during locomotion, how animals swim and fly, and how they run, walk and jump effectively on land. Class discussion and student presentation of recent primary literature will be an integral part of the course. Labs will include the analysis of video images to calculate accelerations and power during movement, and the use of force plates to quantify contact forces during running and jumping.

Warfare, communication, agriculture, and caring for family are phenomena that are typically attributed to human societies, but social insects do these same things. In this course, we will explore the weird and wonderful world of social insects to discover their diverse strategies for success. We will learn about how conflict and selfishness have shaped the cooperative effort that characterizes these seemingly utopian communities. Topics will include the natural history of social insects, self organization in systems, models of division of labor, communication, and an examination of some of the biological oddities that have arisen as a result of kin selection. The format for the course will consist of demonstrations of basic principles, followed by discussion and presentation of classic literature and groundbreaking current research.

An introduction to the art of film designed for first year students, this course explores the excitement of contemporary global filmmaking. Through selected films and readings, the course focuses on the basic elements of filmic language including mise-en-sc�ne, editing, cinematography, the relation of sound to image, and narrative structure. Students learn to view the art of film not only as a medium for personal expression, but also as a complex interplay between aesthetic, ideological, economic, and technological concerns. Discussions will examine in detail how today's filmmakers are utilizing both traditional cinematic forms and emerging new media technologies and the ways they are changing the cinema experience in the twenty-first century.

CAMS 101 introduces students to the study of audio-visual media, including oral, print, photographic, cinematic, broadcast, and digital media forms and practices. Using a case study approach, we will explore the nature of audio-visual communication/representation in historical, cultural, disciplinary, and media-specific contexts, and examine different theoretical and critical perspectives on the role and power of media to influence our social values, political beliefs, identities, and behaviors. We'll also consider how consumers of media representations can and do contest and unsettle their embedded messages. Our emphasis will be on developing the research and analytical tools, modes of reading, and forms of critical practice that can help us to negotiate the increasingly mediated world in which we live.

Between Reality and Magic: A Century of Cinema, Part 2
1
Cinema's first century is a vast, wondrous universe where art, media technology, and political economy variously intertwine. This course charts a path through this universe by casting a spotlight on exemplary constellations: films that captured our imagination, significant artists, groundbreaking movements, transnational synergies. Part 2 surveys postwar film history until the end of the twentieth century. We examine the worldwide emergence and energy of new cinemas during the epochal changes brought about by sexual and cultural revolutions, postcolonialism, and multiculturalism. Against the background of a shifting world order and technological transformations affecting how films are made, distributed, and viewed, we shall explore the vexed question of art cinema's implicit opposition to the ethos of fast consumption, asking ourselves: whither cinema after its hundredth anniversary?

This course explores the cinematic conventions and experiments employed by Chinese filmmakers over the past hundred years. Unique Chinese film genres such as left-wing melodrama, martial arts films, and model play adaptations, as well as the three "new waves" in China's recent avant-garde cinema, will be examined and discussed. Individual filmic visions and techniques experimented with by important directors such as Fei Mu, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Zhang Yimou, and Jia Zhangke will be closely analyzed. Class discussions will aim to help students understand the history, politics, and aesthetics of Chinese cinema. Theoretical aspects of film studies will also be incorporated into class readings and discussions. No prior knowledge of China or film studies is required.

"Being There": Documentary Film and Media
1
This course surveys the history, theory, and practice of documentary film, considering the ways its forms and ethics have changed since the beginning of cinema. We study the major modes of the documentary, including cinema verité, direct cinema, investigative documentary, ethnographic film, agit-prop and activist media, and the personal essay, as well as recent forms such as the docudrama, the archival film, “mockumentary,” and Web-based forms. We will examine the “reality effects” of these works, focusing on the ways in which they create their authority. We will ask: How do these films shape notions of truth, reality, and point of view? What are the ethics and politics of representation and who speaks for whom when we watch a documentary? What do documentaries make visible or conceal?

Gendering the Bronze Screen: Representations of Chicanas/Latinas in Film
1
The history of Chican@s and Latin@s on the big screen is a long and complicated one. To understand the changes that have occurred in the representation of Chican@s/Latin@s, this course proposes an analysis of films that traces various stereotypes to examine how those images have been perpetuated, altered, and ultimately resisted. From the Anglicizing of names to the erasure of racial backgrounds, the ways in which Chican@s and Latin@s are represented has been contingent on ideologies of race, gender, class and sexuality. We will be examining how films have typecast Chicanas/Latinas as criminals or as "exotic" based on their status as women of color, and how Chicano/Latino filmmakers continue the practice of casting Chicanas/Latinas solely as supporting characters to male protagonists.

Ethnographic Film
1
This seminar explores ethnographic film as a genre for representing "reality," anthropological knowledge, and cultural lives. We will examine how ethnographic film emerged in a particular intellectual and political economic context as well as how subsequent conceptual and formal innovations have shaped the genre. We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of the contexts for producing and circulating these works; the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation; and the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate ethnographic film within the larger project for representing "culture," addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices, including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, and documentary film.

Asian American Women in Film
1
This course will serve as an introduction to representations of Asian/American women in film beginning with silent classics and ending with contemporary social media.  In the first half of the course, we examine the legacy of Orientalism, the politics of interracial romance, the phenomenon of "yellow face", and the different constructions of Asian American femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. In the second half of the course, we look at "Asian American cinema" where our focus will be on contemporary works, drawing upon critical materials from film theory, feminist studies, Asian American studies, history, and cultural studies.

Experimental Ethnography: At the Boundaries of Art and Anthropology
1
This course explores the territory of ethnography as it is practiced at the intersection of art and anthropology. Ethnography is a practice of anthropological knowledge production that involves engaging with cultural identity and difference. It raises issues about the relationship between the Self and Other, representation and reality. Although traditionally, ethnographies are written manuscripts, anthropologists are experimenting with ethnographic representation in other media and formats. Artists engaged in conceptual, social and site-specific modes are engaging in parallel ethnographic practices. Through this course, students will be introduced to the history and contemporary efflorescence of these experiments and cross-pollinations.

This course explores the cinematic conventions and experiments employed by Chinese filmmakers over the past hundred years. Unique Chinese film genres such as left-wing melodrama, martial arts films and model play adaptations, as well as the three "new waves" in China's recent avant-garde cinema, will be examined and discussed. Individual filmic visions and techniques experimented with by important directors such as Fei Mu, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Zhang Yimou, and Jia Zhangke will be closely analyzed. Class discussions will aim to help students understand the history, politics, and aesthetics of Chinese cinema. Theoretical aspects of film studies will also be incorporated into class readings and discussions. No prior knowledge of China or film studies is required.

Chinese Ideas, Ideas of China (in English)
1
The land and culture we call “China” and “Chinese” today have been shaped by the twin influences of China’s own past and the global present, when it is one among many nations competing for cultural and economic standing. Through readings and films, this course will explore the diversity of Chinese ideas, from antiquity to the present, about such topics as the family, the state, tradition and the burden of the past, changing views of female autonomy, notions of filial duty and “Confucian values,” tensions between public and private values and duties, and ideas about the supernatural. We will also consider what it means to study a civilization or culture, and look both at how China and the Chinese have been perceived by foreigners and how Chinese writers have presented China and its peoples to foreigners. No previous knowledge of China or the Chinese language expected.

We will read the original tales of classical heroes and heroines together with more modern treatments in film and literature. Why do these stories continue to engage, entertain, and even shock us? What is the nature and power of myth? Readings from ancient sources in English translation.

World Literature
1
This course is an introduction to the study of world literature. Students will read a selection of foundational works of literature from a variety of times and cultures, observing those qualities that allowed the works to transcend their historical moment in order to enter into global consciousness. We will study the assigned texts from three points of view: as individual works of literary art, as rising out of a specific cultural context, and as works that have escaped that original context into other languages and ages. Noting how some meanings are lost in translation and others gained, students will develop a mode of reading and a critical vocabulary. The required readings will likely be drawn from the following works:,Taught primarily in lecture and not writing-intensive.

and,; and Herodotus and Thucydides invented the genre of history as we know it. On the political front, Athens defended itself against the Persian empire, developed into the most powerful city-state in the Mediterranean, and then dramatically fell as the result of failed imperial policy. In the early fourth century, Plato engaged with the political and intellectual conflicts of this period in,, and,In the fifth century B.C.E., Athens was home to great intellectual ferment as well as political growth and crisis. This intellectual revolution resulted in significant artistic and intellectual accomplishments: Pericles oversaw the building of the Acropolis; citizens saw productions of,. In this course, students will consider works of philosophy, history, tragedy, comedy, rhetoric, and political theory in their cultural and political context. We will examine and interrogate Athenian democracy, its conflicts, and its stunning and influential cultural achievements.

Romans, Jews, and Christians in the Roman Empire
1
At the birth of the Roman Empire virtually all of its inhabitants were practicing polytheists. Three centuries later, the Roman Emperor Constantine was baptized as a Christian and his successors eventually banned public sacrifices to the gods and goddesses who had been traditionally worshipped around the Mediterranean. This course will examine Roman-era Judaism, Graeco-Roman polytheism, and the growth of the Jesus movement into the dominant religion of the late antique world.

Tangible User Interfaces
1
Tangible user interfaces emerge as a novel human-computer interaction style that interlinks the physical and digital worlds. Extending beyond the limitations of the computer mouse, keyboard, and monitor, tangible user interfaces allow users to take advantage of their natural spatial skills while supporting collaborative work. Students will be introduced to conceptual frameworks, the latest research, and a variety of techniques for designing and building these interfaces. Developing tangible interfaces requires creativity as well as an interdisciplinary perspective. Hence, students will work in teams to design, prototype, and physically build tangible user interfaces.

Environmental and Resource Economics
1
This course considers the economic aspects of resource and environmental issues. After examining the concepts of externalities, public goods, and common property resources, we will discuss how to measure the cost and benefits of environmental policy in order to estimate the socially optimal level of the environmental good. Applications of these tools will be made to air and water pollution, renewable and nonrenewable resources, and global climate. In addressing each of these problems we will compare various public policy responses such as regulation, marketable permits, and tax incentives.

Understanding and Improving Schools
1
Can schools remedy inequalities, or do they reflect and (re)produce them? Drawing from work in educational anthropology, sociology, history, and critical theory, we ask what schools are meant to produce and how this production functions in the everyday life of schooling. We first examine the proposition that schools can be oppressive spaces, and then consider how communities have organized their own struggles to demand and define humanizing and liberatory education. We ask—always—what the purpose of education should be.

This seminar provides a foundation for understanding the politics surrounding bilingual education policies since the rise of a federal bilingual education act in 1968. After an introductory overview of the intersection of language, education and nation-building, the course chronologically follows the trajectory of bilingual education politics and policy through five decades. We will study how bilingual education politics and policy were shaped by a range of other policies, patterns, movements and controversies, including the 1965 Immigration Act, the civil rights and power movements of the 1960-70s, the 1980s English-only movement, the 1990s “culture wars,” globalization and its effects on the in/out-flows of jobs and immigrants, racialization and retrenchment of welfare state policies, and the rise of standardized testing and accountability regimes.

Great Works of Poetry

A study of the major poems and poets of the English language, from Anglo-Saxon riddles to the works of our contemporaries. How have poets found forms and language adequate to their desires to praise, to curse, to mourn, to seduce? How, on shifting historical and cultural grounds, have poems, over time, remained useful and necessary to human life? Approximately 1,000 years of poetry will be studied, but special attention will be brought in four cases: Shakespeare's Sonnets; John Milton's "Lycidas"; the odes of John Keats; the poems of Emily Dickinson. The course will conclude with a unit on contemporary poets (Sylvia Plath, Elizabeth Bishop, Philip Larkin, John Ashbery and others).

Nonfiction Writing
1
The memoir has in the last generation or two assumed a leading position in American literary culture. It has achieved this position perhaps despite its origins in a once disreputable genre: confessional autobiography. Augustine admits in his,to having been a thief in his boyhood; Rousseau promises in his to tell the reader “even the most truly odious things about myself.” But perhaps the imperative to make the details of private life public particularly appeals to the sensibility of a democratic age. You no longer have to be famous or old to write a memoir. But you must transcend the merely personal. The business of the course is to become accomplished in a form as famous for its intrinsic perils as for its pleasures.

Renaissance Literature
1
,The literary flowering of the English Renaissance was made possible by technology. The arrival of the printing press in England in the 1490s enabled a much wider circulation of literary texts, encouraging writers to influence each other and feeding the tastes of an expanding reading public. At the same time, older manuscript technologies persisted and cross-pollinated with new cultures of print. This course will examine central texts of Renaissance literature, including works by Wyatt, Surrey, Spenser, Sidney, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Milton, investigating how their texts were produced and shaped by the media technologies of their times. The course will use Wellesley’s Special Collections and Book Arts Lab to offer students hands-on experience with Renaissance books and production methods such as papermaking and letterpress printing.

Poets include: Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, the poets of “The New York School” (John Ashbery, Frank O’Hara, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler), Allen Ginsberg, Sylvia Plath, A.R. Ammons, Louise Glück, Robert Pinsky, Anne Carson, Susan Howe, Frank Bidart, Jorie Graham, D.A. Powell, Terrance Hayes, Tracy K. Smith, and others.

“Reader, I married him,” Jane Eyre tells us as her novel draws to a close.� Many nineteenth-century novels end with a marriage.� So despite suggestions within the body of the novel that women’s traditional role is not a satisfying one, the heroine often seems contented in that role by the novel’s end.� But what happens if the heroine chooses wrongly? In this course, we will consider novels that look at a heroine’s life after a marriage that she comes to regret, as well as some novels in which the bad romantic choices do not result in marriage. What do these novels of romantic mistake have to say about women's lives? Probable authors: Anne Bront�, Charlotte�Bront�, James, Austen, Eliot. Special attention will be given to the process of researching and writing a long seminar paper.,,

or,This is a class in writing non-fiction prose, the kind that might someday land a writer in,An advanced, intensive writing workshop, open to six students, named for a late Wellesley professor who valued good writing. The instructor and students will meet once in the spring, and students are then expected to work on their projects over the summer.,� Our genre is often called "literary journalism," and here the special skills -- technical precision, ability for physical description, and psychological insight -- necessary for writing fiction are applied to real-life events and personalities. We will read and emulate authors like Joan Didion, Hilton Als, Ian Frazier, John McPhee, and Joseph Mitchell, and each student will produce a 5,000 word-piece of her own.��

Our Modern Irish literature is often at once shocking in its violence and funny, in subversive, sly, and macabre ways. Examples from drama, fiction, poetry, and film will allow us to explore the power of wit and humor to enliven political, domestic, and existential struggles without diminishing their underlying terror.� The course will address literary responses to anti-colonial and sectarian strife in the twentieth century, and will consider how political violence and economic poverty play out in representations of sexual and family relationships.� Readings in contemporary cultural criticism will provide additional perspectives to the primary reading by such authors as Oscar Wilde, J.M. Synge, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Roddy Doyle, Martin McDonagh.� A few recent and contemporary Irish films will also be included.

How can we understand environmental problems if we don’t understand the environment? In this course, we will approach environmental issues as scientific investigators: What do we need to know in order to understand ozone depletion? Mercury pollution? Ocean acidification? Habitat degradation? These are complex issues that are distinct in many ways, but which often share fundamental concepts that draw from many scientific disciplines. By examining the science behind these problems, we will develop the skills required to address them and begin to build a toolbox to tackle new and different problems. Laboratories examine the relationship between humans and the environment by exploring the campus and beyond. We will investigate important issues through hands-on physical data collection, high tech analysis, and modeling/mapping. ES 101, ES 102, and ES 103 may be taken in any order.

This course considers the economic aspects of resource and environmental issues. After examining the concepts of externalities, public goods, and common property resources, we will discuss how to measure the cost and benefits of environmental policy in order to estimate the socially optimal level of the environmental good. Applications of these tools will be made to air and water pollution, renewable and nonrenewable resources, and global climate. In addressing each of these problems we will compare various public policy responses such as regulation, marketable permits, and tax incentives.

U.S. Environmental Politics
1
This course examines the politics of environmental issues in the United States. The course has two primary goals: First, to introduce students to the institutions, stakeholders, and political processes important to debates over environmental policy at the federal level. Second, to develop and practice skills of analyzing and making decisions relevant to environmental politics and policy. Drawing on the literature of environmental politics and policy, this course will consider how environmental issues are framed in political discourse, various approaches to environmental advocacy and reform, and the contested role of science in environmental politics. The course will be organized around environmental case studies, including endangered species conservation, public lands management, air and water pollution, and toxics regulation.

This course offers a critical panorama of French cinema while also building essential vocabulary and critical concepts for film analysis. Students will pay specific attention to the various connections between cinema, urban space, and notions of modernity. Close analyses of clips in class will also lead to a deeper appreciation of genre and technical aspects in the history of cinema. Filmmakers studied will include the Lumi�re Brothers (for the “perspective” model), Georges M�li�s (for the cinema of attraction), Jean Renoir (for depth of field), Robert Bresson (for literary adaptation), Jean-Luc Godard (for traveling shots and direct sound), and Chris Marker (for documentary).

Major authors from the Medieval period through the Enlightenment studied in their historical and cultural contexts, with emphasis on close reading, critical analysis, and writing in French. Attention to literary genres, including the constraints and innovations they engender, and study of key notions that will inform students' understanding of French literature and history—galanterie, courtoisie, mimesis, poetics, epistolarity, Salic law, French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes, and Absolutism. We will end with consideration of pre-revolutionary works, anticipating the rise of the French Republic.

Male elites in postcolonial Africa dominated the independence era with liberation movements such as "négritude." Women's position in both public culture and private spaces was ambiguous, rapidly changing, even contentious. Our study of a variety of media, while placing literary texts at the center, will seek to understand the place of women in the Francophone context and in postcolonial nations more widely.

Geologic processes both rapid (earthquakes and landslides) and slow (mountain building and sea level rise) are intimately linked with sustaining the diversity of life on the planet. This course will examine these and other processes in which the atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere are linked via the flow of energy and mass. Laboratory exercises and field trips will introduce skills needed to observe and document processes shaping our environment. Problem solving in small groups during class time will foster critical thinking, and classroom debates between larger teams will focus research and communications skills on current issues in geosciences such as building and removing dams, and the science surrounding global climate change.

The,and the Emergence of Modern France
1
The term,(1880-1914) evokes images of Parisian boulevards, bustling cafés, glittering shop windows, and Montmartre cabarets, all symbols of modern consumer culture. No emblem of the era is as iconic as the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the World’s Fair of 1889 as a tribute to French technology and progress. During the years preceding World War I, Paris was the center of the European avant-garde—indeed, the capital of modernity. While cultural ebullience is its hallmark, this period also witnessed the definitive establishment of a republican regime, the expansion of an overseas empire, and the integration of the countryside into national life. Drawing on historical documents and literary texts as well as films, posters, and songs, this interdisciplinary course examines French culture, politics, and society during the era that ushered France into the modern age.

The Earth is a dynamic planet—driven by processes that operate on its surface and within. In this course we study these processes as well as interactions between the solid earth, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere that together produce the environment we live in. Topics covered include the origin and history of the Earth, plate tectonics, the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, hydrology, landscape evolution, and global climate; these processes influence our lives daily. Laboratory exercises, project work, and local field trips provide hands-on opportunities to develop key concepts and hone observational and analytical skills.

1.25
Sediments and sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's present surface. Sedimentology encompasses the study of the origin, transport, deposition, and lithification of sedimentary rocks and is critical to accurate interpretation of the geologic rock record. Observations of modern sedimentary processes illuminate past environments; sedimentary strata record evidence of mountain building and seismic activity, glacial advances and paleoclimate cycles, and preserve the fossil record. Natural resources including groundwater, coal, and petroleum are found in sedimentary rocks. Society is impacted by sedimentary processes in popular human habitats including coastlines and flood plains. Readings and discussions build students' familiarity with topics such as sediment transport, stratigraphy, and modern and ancient depositional environments. A semester-long project, laboratory exercises, and  weekend field trips emphasize field methods, rock identification, and data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

This course will examine exile—both internal and geographic—through contemporary memoirs, let­ters, novels, and films. Our primary focus will be on Jews and Muslims living in North Africa and the Middle East. Questions to be asked include, How was community defined? What provided the author with a sense of belonging? What prompts his/her exile? Is the homeland portable? If so, how, and on what terms? Each week we shall explore a different expression of exile. Discussion will include comparisons and contrasts with previous readings.

From Conquest to Revolution: A History of Colonial Latin America
1
The "discovery" by Christopher Columbus in 1492 of the "New World" unleashed a process of dramatic changes in what we now call Latin America. Spanning roughly from the fifteenth through the mid-eighteenth centuries, this course examines the ideological underpinnings of the Spanish Conquest, the place of the Americas in a universal Spanish empire, and the role of urban centers in the consolidation of Spanish rule. Emphasis is placed on indigenous societies and the transformation and interactions with Africans and Europeans under colonial rule; the role of Indian labor and African slavery in the colonial economy; the creation, consolidation, and decline of colonial political institutions; and, finally, the role of religion and baroque ritual in the creation of new hybrid colonial cultures and identities.

These include the Black Death, the Renaissance, the creation of seaborne empires and the discovery of new worlds, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the coming of capitalism, a multitude of devastating wars, and changes in urban and rural landscapes - all set against the backdrop of European people's ongoing efforts to define their relationships to their own medieval and ancient forerunners and to the world's other peoples.

Gender and Sexuality in Twentieth-Century Europe
1
Issues of gender and sexuality were central to projects of social and political transformation in twentieth-century Europe. Regimes of nationalism, socialism, fascism, and capitalism each provided prescriptive models of "good" and "healthy" gender relationships, making sexuality the frequent and ongoing site for state and scientific intervention. At the same time, the ruptures of two world wars and the effects of modernization created spaces for unprecedented challenges to sexual mores from below. This course explores the fraught, and occasionally deadly, debates over sexual normalcy in twentieth-century Europe through the topics of eugenics, psychoanalysis, first- and second-wave feminism, the sexual politics of fascism, and the rise of the permissive society.

Cities in Modern Europe
1
This lecture course explores the uses and visions of the city in Europe since the mid-nineteenth century. The course covers both the history of modern urban planning and the responses to it—the way the city was designed and the way it was inhabited. We will begin by looking at differing theories of the city: Was it a place of freedom or increased control, especially for socially marginalized groups like women, colonized populations, and the poor? Was it an artifact of dominant social forces or a space for individual self-creation? Themes we will cover include colonial urbanism, modernism, fascist city planning, suburbanization, tourism, migration, and reclamations of urban space by social movements, squatters, and youth subcultures.

The Social History of American Capitalism from Revolution to Empire
1
There is perhaps no better time than the present to study the history of American capitalism, as political leaders, pundits, bank and business executives, and workers across the world struggle to negotiate a reprieve from our current economic crisis. This course will explore the development of American capitalism from its birth in the mercantile world of imperial Great Britain through the financial ruin of the Great Depression. This course will closely examine the relationship between government, business, and society by engaging key moments in nineteenth-century American economic history: the rise of the corporation, transportation and communication innovations, industrialization, American slavery and commodity production, financial speculation and panics, the development of American banking, immigration policy, and labor relations.

An exploration of Imperial Russia over the course of two tumultuous centuries from the astonishing reign of Peter the Great at the start of the eighteenth century, to the implosion of the Russian monarchy under the unfortunate Nicholas II early in the twentieth, as Russia plunged toward revolution. St. Petersburg—the stunning and ghostly birthplace of Russia's modern history and the symbol of Russia's attempt to impose order on a vast, multiethnic empire—is a focus of this course. We will also emphasize the everyday lives of peasants and nobles; the vision and ideology of autocracy; Russia's brilliant intelligentsia; and the glory of her literary canon.

The City in South Asia
1
South Asian cities are currently undergoing massive demographic and spatial transformations. These cannot be understood without a consideration of both the specific history of South Asia and a broader account of urban change. This course examines these changes in historical perspective and situates urban South Asia within a global context. How did colonial rule transform old cities such as Delhi and Lahore? How were the differing ideologies of India and Pakistan mapped onto new capitals such as Chandigarh and Islamabad? How are ethnic pasts and techno futures reconciled in booming cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai? What are the connections between the urban environment and political mobilization? We consider a range of sources, including scholarly literature, films, and short stories.

Topics in Chinese Commerce and Business
1
China’s stunning economic growth and the increasing visibility of transnational businesses run by entrepreneurs of Chinese descent have produced many efforts to explain the successes of “Chinese capitalism” and the “Chinese model.” Central to many arguments are debatable approaches to culture and history. Is there a uniquely Chinese way of doing business? Has mainland China developed a revolutionary new path of economic development? This course engages these debates through influential works on Chinese business and economic history, from the nineteenth century through the reform period (1978 to the present). Topics include corporate governance and the financing of firms; the role of kinship and networking (,); changing political contexts of development; competition with foreign firms; the impact of globalization; and debates over China’s remarkable economic rise.

Seminar. World War II as Memory and Myth
1
This seminar explores the many ways that victors and vanquished, victims and perpetrators, governments, political groups, and individuals have remembered, celebrated, commemorated, idealized, condemned, condoned, forgotten, ignored, and grappled with the vastly complex history and legacy of World War II in the past half-century. Our primary focus is the war in Europe, including Poland and Russia, although we will also consider the United States and Japan. We will investigate the construction of individual and collective memories about World War II and the creation and subsequent transformation of set myths about the war experience. In addition to books and articles, sources will include memoirs, primary documents, and films. We will also study the impact of war memories on international relations and analyze the "monumental politics" of war memorials.

International History Seminar
1
Readings in the histories of ethnic and religious violence. A crucial aspect of contemporary international history is the large-scale ethnic and religious violence that has marked civil wars throughout the world, from the former Yugoslavia to Somalia and Sierra Leone, and from Israel to Sri Lanka and Tibet. Though such violence is often labeled ethnic or religious, its causes are much broader. A conceptual unbundling of causal strands (diachronic and synchronic) can bring into focus different ways of dealing with the legacy of violence. Readings will also focus on local and international (humanitarian, legal, cultural, and military) interventions to end such conflicts, as well as approaches to post-conflict reconstruction. Students will choose their own research topics, and will approach them through the lens of the conceptual readings of the syllabus.

This seminar explores the history of race from the American Revolution through the First World War. In this seminar we will explore what race means in the United States by examining the varied ways that it has shaped—and was shaped by—key moments in nineteenth century American history. Topics covered will include: slavery, the conquest of the American West, immigration, citizenship and the nation-state, Social Darwinism, the Great Migration, and American imperialism. Throughout the course we will seek to understand race in the United States by exploring the following questions: What is "race"? If it is but a concept or idea, how and why has it affected so many lives and dictated so much of our past?

Seminar. Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar: The Making of Modern India
1
The creation of the world's largest democracy brought powerful ideas into contact and conflict: the overthrow of colonial rule through a philosophy of nonviolence; the desire to industrialize rapidly; and the quest to end centuries of caste discrimination. This seminar explores the key ideas that shaped modern India through the lives of three extraordinary individuals. How did Gandhi's experiments with food and sex affect his vision of India? How did Nehru's understanding of world history structure his program of industrialization? How did Ambedkar's untouchable upbringing shape his agenda? Could Gandhi's nonviolent agenda be sustained? Could an India based on individual transformation also annihilate caste? We engage extensively with primary sources such as autobiographies, writings, and speeches, as well as scholarly accounts and films.

Italian Mysteries introduces students to the Italian tradition of mystery and detective writing of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with particular attention paid to its philosophical and semiotic dimensions. It also exposes students to some of the political mysteries that have characterized Italy since the end of World War II and which have become the subject of much contemporary mystery writing, films, and documentaries. From an aesthetic standpoint, we will ask why a new generation of young writers has been drawn to these mysteries as subjects of their writings and examine the variety of narrative forms they use to investigate them. Authors to be studied will include Carlo Emilio Gadda, Umberto Eco, Carlo Luccarelli, Dario Fo, Simone Sarasso, Giuseppe Genna, and the writing collectives known as Luther Blisset and Wu Ming.

Between Transcendence and Transgression: Desire from Dante to Milton

This course takes as its focus the discourses of desire informing some of the major works of English and Italian literature from the Middle Ages to the seventeenth century. Through an exploration of the themes of transcendence and transgression in Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ariosto, and Milton, students will analyze the dynamics of desire (whether sexual, psychological, or textual) that open up exciting vistas on the tensions between human and divine love, excess and control, lack and fulfillment, suffering and joy. The roles of transcendence and transgression will also be considered in the relationship each author entertains with his or her literary models and predecessors to see how desire shapes a dialogue across geographical and temporal boundaries.

Longing, dreams, and transformations, recurrent subjects in early Japanese Literature, are familiar to us from animation and popular culture. We will return to the beginnings of these themes in the great works of Japanese poetry and prose in translation from the seventh through the eighteenth centuries:The Pillowbook, The Tale of Genji, medieval tales of miraculous transformations, puppet plays and kabuki, among others. Who were the writers, and for whom were they writing? What role did Buddhism and Shinto play? How were the concepts of longing and dream transformed into a unique esthetic that has continued to influence Japanese culture?

This course focuses not on systematically reviewing grammar but on concrete reading techniques that go beyond just looking up every word and on large and small-scale literary and rhetorical analysis.  We'll read major works of Latin literature, with the specific works chosen depending in part on the interests of the students in the class; possible choices might include selections from an ancient novel or a history, a philosophical essay, an oration, or a biography.

An Introduction to Korean Language and Culture (in English)
1
This course aims to provide a fundamental understanding of Korean culture, society, and the Korean people by focusing on the Korean language. The development of language occurs in dynamic relation to culture and community. Topics include the origin and history of the Korean language, the writing system (Hangeul-Korean alphabet), different dialects (including North Korean dialects), cross-linguistic analysis, intercultural communication, language use in pop culture, language variation across generations, neologism (new word formation) and slang, etc. The historical trajectory of Korean will be examined in relation to relevant sociopolitical and cultural trends. We will also explore diverse issues in contemporary Korean and popular culture using articles, films, dramas, etc. This course is expected to develop cross-cultural perspectives on the Korean language and its rich cultural heritage.

Language: Form and Meaning
1
This course will consider some basic questions about language: What do we actually know when we know a language? How is the structure of language best described? Are there properties which all languages share, and what do those properties tell us about language itself? We will look at specific problems in morphology, syntax, and semantics, and the strengths and weaknesses of different linguistic theories will be considered. While many of the problems considered in this class will involve English, we will also be looking at other languages, both European and non-European.

Exploration of the relationship of language to mind and culture through the study of bilingualism. The bilingual individual will be the focus for questions concerning language and mind: The detection of "foreign" accent, the relationship of words to concepts, the organization of the mental lexicon, language specialization of the brain, and the effects of early bilingualism on cognitive functioning. The bilingual nation will be the focus for questions dealing with language and culture: societal conventions governing use of one language over another, effects of extended bilingualism on language development and change, and political and educational impact of a government's establishing official bilingualism.

Calculus I
1
Introduction to differential and integral calculus for functions of one variable. The heart of calculus is the study of rates of change. Differential calculus concerns the process of finding the rate at which a quantity is changing (the derivative). Integral calculus reverses this process. Information is given about the derivative, and the process of integration finds the "integral," which measures accumulated change. This course aims to develop a thorough understanding of the concepts of differentiation and integration, and covers techniques and applications of differentiation and integration of algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. MATH 115 is an introductory course designed for students who have not seen calculus before.

Advanced Linear Algebra
1
Linear algebra at this more advanced level is a basic tool in many areas of mathematics and other fields. The course begins by revisiting some linear algebra concepts from MATH 206 in a more sophisticated way, making use of the mathematical maturity picked up in MATH 305. Such topics include vector spaces, linear independence, bases, and dimensions, linear transformations, and inner product spaces. Then we will turn to new notions, including dual spaces, reflexivity, annihilators, direct sums and quotients, tensor products, multilinear forms, and modules. One of the main goals of the course is the derivation of canonical forms, including triangular form and Jordan canonical forms. These are methods of analyzing matrices that are more general and powerful than diagonalization (studied in MATH 206). We will also discuss the spectral theorem, the best example of successful diagonalization, and its applications.

Selected Topics
1
A matrix group is a group of invertible matrices. Matrix groups arise in virtually every investigation of objects with symmetries, including molecules in chemistry, particles in physics, and projective spaces in geometry. They are an essential tool in animated graphics programming, quantum computing and more. A matrix group is simultaneously an algebraic and geometric object. The interplay between the algebra and geometry of matrix groups make this a rich subject.,Topics will include the rigid motions of the sphere, general linear groups, and the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic groups (O(n), U(n) and Sp(n)). We will also discuss elementary topology (continuity, compactness and path-connectedness) of matrix groups, Lie algebras as tangent spaces, and the exponential map.

Between Transcendence and Transgression: Desire from Dante to Milton
1
This course takes as its focus the discourses of desire informing some of the major works of English and Italian literature from the Middle Ages to the seventeenth century. Through an exploration of the themes of transcendence and transgression in Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ariosto, and Milton, students will analyze the dynamics of desire (whether sexual, psychological, or textual) that open up exciting vistas on the tensions between human and divine love, excess and control, lack and fulfillment, suffering and joy. The roles of transcendence and transgression will also be considered in the relationship each author entertains with his or her literary models and predecessors to see how desire shapes a dialogue across geographical and temporal boundaries.

Topics in Instrumental Music
1
Franz Schubert once reportedly said, "I hope to make
something of myself, but who can do anything after Beethoven?" One un-Beethovenian
thing Schubert did was to set more than 600 poems to music. This course will explore
how his instrumental music came more and more to suggest the themes of reverie,
recollection, and alienation so prevalent in that poetry. When 18-year-old
Robert Schumann learned of Schubert's death, he is said to have wept all night.
We shall also investigate how Schumann's instrumental music of the following
decades, so influenced by Schubert's song cycles, explored in its own ways the
extreme contrasts of mood so characteristic of the poetry of Schumann's
contemporaries.

American Popular Music in the Twentieth Century
1
"Popular music" denotes a variety of idioms—including R&B, rock, soul, funk, and hip-hop—linked to the youth culture and social movements that developed in the United States after World War II. With a foundation in African American genres (especially blues and gospel), popular music has also absorbed strong influences from rural white Protestant communities, Latin America, and Europe, and its sounds are indelibly linked to twentieth-century technologies (the electric guitar, multitrack recording, turntables). With an emphasis on the 1940s to the 1970s, our historical survey of American popular music will bring us from the 1800s to the present day. Using close listening as a starting point, we will learn how to decode sounds to reveal their complex social histories as we assess popular music's role in America's tumultuous twentieth century.

We will examine the nature of the visual stimulus and the physiological mechanisms that trigger perception. In parallel, we will explore how such processes drive the practice of art at different times and in different cultures. The course will employ experimental investigations of your own visual system, guided analysis of art objects, exercises in making art, field trips, examinations of illusions, and inquiries into machine vision. The interdisciplinary nature of the course requires an advanced level of participation, commitment, and self-directed learning culminating in a final project of your own design.

First-Year Seminar: Friendship
1
 This seminar undertakes a philosophical examination of the nature and value of friendship. Two questions will animate the course: What is a friend? And, why are friends valuable? Drawing examples from literature and films, we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. Many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake; we will consider whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. We'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. Finally, we will compare the love that characterizes friendship with the feelings that sustain relationships with parents, children, and lovers.

Philosophy of Art
1
In this course, we will examine a broad set of philosophical questions raised by art. What is art? How do we know what it means (if it does mean anything)? What is beauty? What does it mean to have an aesthetic experience, and what grants an object or activity aesthetic value? What is the relationship between aesthetics and ethics? In exploring these general questions we will consider topics such as taste, horror, mimesis, creativity, forgery, public art, and popular art. We will take into account diverse art forms, including, but not limited to, painting, photography, sculpture, literature, music, film, and dance. We will also consider the place of the aesthetic in nature and everyday experience.

Ancient Greek Philosophy
1
An introduction to the work of Plato, Aristotle, and select Hellenistic philosophers that aims to develop students' skills in analyzing and constructing philosophical arguments with attention to historical context. Focusing on the ways in which various ancient philosophical views formed internally consistent systems, we will address a range of central topics in ancient thought, including issues in ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, and epistemology. The course will deal primarily with Plato and Aristotle and end with a briefer treatment of the Epicureans, Stoics, and Skeptics.

Logic
1
Logic studies the principles of valid, or correct, reasoning. It does this by looking for ways to regiment the relationship between a conclusion and the claims that support it. In this course, we will learn how to translate sentences of English into a symbolic language that brings out their logically relevant properties, and we will study formal methods—methods sensitive only to the form of the arguments, as opposed to their content—that allow us to determine whether the conclusions of arguments follow from their premises. Some consideration is given to the limits of the system itself as well as to the relationship between logic and ordinary language.

Philosophy of Mind
1
What is a mind? How is it related to a person's brain and body? These two questions have driven centuries of work in the philosophy of mind, and we will take them as our starting point. After considering a variety of answers, we will pursue several topics that challenge our best accounts of the mind: consciousness, mental representation, the emotions, free will, and the possibility of thinking machines. Our goal will be to connect central philosophical perspectives on these issues with contributions from psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

Environmental Ethics
1
Do nonhuman animals, plants, species, ecosystems, or wilderness have moral value beyond their relation to human interests? Do we have moral duties to refrain from harming the natural world or to preserve it for future generations? How should we weigh environmental concerns against other concerns (such as the elimination of poverty or economic growth) in cases where they come into conflict? How should the benefits of the environment, and the burdens of conserving it, be shared across individuals or countries? Does recognition of the importance of the environment call for a brand new kind of moral philosophy or merely a more sophisticated application of an old one? This course will examine a variety of philosophical answers to these questions and apply those answers to a set of pressing current issues, including global climate change; population policy and reproductive freedom; the local food movement; and the use of nonhuman animals for food, research, and entertainment.

Seminar in Modern Philosophy
1
What would philosophy look like if we eliminated all metaphysical concepts that are not confirmed by ordinary experience? Locke, Berkeley, and Hume argue that we should reject, among other things, metaphysical conceptions of the self, causation, and the external world. We will examine their arguments for these conclusions. But what, then, becomes of the self once we deny that the self is a substantial and enduring entity? Likewise what becomes of causation and human action once we deny that causal powers exist in the world and in ourselves? And, finally, what becomes of scientific inquiry once we deny that there is an external world of material bodies? We will also examine their responses to these questions. The empiricists develop ingenious accounts of the world and of the mind that attempt to do without any controversial metaphysical claims; we will compare these efforts and consider whether they succeed.

First-Year Seminar: Einstein and the Dark Universe
1
This seminar explores Einstein's theory of relativity and two fundamental puzzles in physics: dark matter and dark energy.  Taught in a hands-on/workshop format, students will carry out an experimental test of relativity, as well as computational analyses which reveal that the Universe expansion is accelerating and that 80% of the matter in the Universe is fundamentally different from all known particles in the Standard Model of particle physics.  We will also discuss the ongoing experimental search for the elusive dark matter particle, as well as efforts to understand the nature of dark energy. No prior physics background is assumed. We will make use of high school algebra and geometry in our work.�Not to be counted toward the minimum physics major or to fulfill the physics entrance requirement for medical school.

Fundamentals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics with Laboratory
1.25
This second semester of classical physics concentrates on the fundamental forces of electricity and magnetism. The electric and magnetic forces are entirely responsible for the structures and interactions of atoms and molecules, the properties of all solids, and the structure and function of biological material. Our technological society is largely dependent on the myriad applications of the physics of electricity and magnetism, e.g., motors and generators, communications systems, and the architecture of computers. After developing quantitative descriptions of electricity and magnetism, we explore the relations between them, leading us to an understanding of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon. The course will consider both ray-optics and wave-optics descriptions of light. Laboratory exercises will emphasize electrical circuits, electronic measuring instruments, optics, and optical experiments.

The development of quantum mechanics represented one of the most fundamental revolutions in our understanding of the natural world. Quantum mechanics forms the basis for our knowledge of atoms, molecules, and solid-state systems as well as of nuclei and fundamental particles. Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and their connection to properties of matter and to processes in natural and constructed systems. This course introduces both of these important branches of physics and looks at their links by investigating such phenomena as atomic and molecular heat capacities, and the statistical basis for blackbody radiation and the second law of thermodynamics. Einstein's theory of special relativity, another cornerstone of modern physics, will also be introduced.

Electromagnetic Theory

Richard Feynman once said, "From a long view of the history of mankind—seen from, say, ten thousand years from now—there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the nineteenth century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade." In this course we will study the classical theory of electromagnetic fields and waves as developed by Maxwell. Topics include boundary value problems, electromagnetic radiation and its interaction with matter, and the connection between electrodynamics and relativity.

First-Year Seminar: Mexico: Revolution, Democracy, and Drugs
1
Mexico is a country of remarkable contradictions. Unleashing one of the great revolutions of the twentieth century in 1910, the revolutionaries and their heirs then ruled Mexico for 71 years. Developing a genuine multiparty political system only since 2000, Mexico's democracy now faces an array of daunting challenges, including the increasing power of drug cartels whose tactics of violence and intimidation threaten the entire nation. Our seminar will aim to make sense out of the fascinating puzzle that is Mexico. We will focus on its twentieth-century Revolution, its distinctive political system (including the return to power of the PRI in 2013), and its current social, economic, and political challenges. We will examine its complex relationship with the United States, emphasizing the dual issues of immigration and drugs.

Africa in the World
1
Sub-Saharan Africa's role in the world has changed dramatically since 2000. Global commodity shortages, China's new investments, the continent's rapid recovery from the Great Recession, the United States' new concerns about global terrorism, the U.N. system's commitment peace building after the wars of the 1990s and its concern with the continent's lagging achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and the controversy over the stalled Doha Round of trade talks have fundamentally changed Africa's position in the world. This course explores the explanations offered for these changes by political economists and security analysts, investigates the opportunities that have opened for African policy makers (both public and private), and considers how they might respond.

Seminar. Small Wars and Insurgencies
1
We often think of warfare in conventional terms: states fight other states in large-scale battles employing uniformed soldiers to conquer enemy territory. In reality, however, there are many instances of asymmetric conflicts involving non-state actors who avoid open battles, whose fighters are indistinguishable from civilians, and who seek a wide variety of political objectives. Peasant revolts, communist insurrections, ethnic rebellions, and terrorist movements are among the various ways in which the weak have attempted to use violence to break the will of the strong. We address these wars from a theoretical, historical, and contemporary perspective. We will explore how classical theorists, including Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, adapted the ideas of Clausewitz to guerilla warfare. We will examine how rebel groups—whether the Spanish guerillas, Boer commandos, Chinese communists, or Serb militias—employed violence to intimidate their opponents. We will consider how globalization and the diffusion of military technology have transformed guerilla conflicts, and debate the implications of our theories for contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.

Seminar. Cooperation and Competition
1
According to traditional models of rationality, rational agents should act in ways that will maximize their self-interest. And the study of evolution teaches us that individuals are in competition for survival. Nonetheless, we have all experienced acts of apparent selflessness, and societies could not function without cooperation among their members. How, then, can cooperative and selfless behaviors be explained? In this course evidence and theories from the psychological, economic, and neurobiological literatures will be examined. Cross-cultural, developmental, and cross-species differences will be explored as will the evolutionary origins of cooperation and competition and the role of cooperation in language.

Seminar. The Psychology of Creativity
1
The study of the psychology of creativity is an exciting and ever-growing area of investigation. While the creative process often appears to be mysterious and outside of our conscious control, creative behavior is something that can be examined, quantified, and fostered. In this seminar, we will explore creativity at the individual, group, societal, and cultural levels. Our readings will combine many of the "classics" in the field with cutting-edge empirical studies of creativity in educational, business, and design settings. In addition to doing a substantial amount of reading and writing, each class member will choose a research topic to investigate as well as a semester-long personalized creativity project.

Seminar. Genes, Brains, and Human Variation
1
Why do some people have a keen memory for names or faces, a great sense of direction, or a remarkable ability to do two things at once? And why are some people only average (or even below average) in these areas? We will critically evaluate a broad range of perceptual and cognitive abilities (and disabilities) by drawing upon the fields of cognitive neuroscience, behavioral genetics, development, and human variation. We will address three kinds of question: What broad combination of nature and nurture, and what specific genes and experiences, contribute to differing abilities? What are the neural and cognitive bases of such abilities? And how can we or should we apply such knowledge to ourselves, our families, our communities, and our countries?

Most adults have limited memories from their childhood and almost no memories from before the age of 3. Students will learn about the factors that influence this phenomenon of 'childhood amnesia' and the course of autobiographical memory development in children. The topic of language features heavily in this course, as language and autobiographical memory are inextricably linked. We will discuss how the language that parents use to reminisce with children influences autobiographical memory development. Additional topics include: language, autobiographical memory and gender, broader societal and cultural influences on memory, atypical language development and its effect on autobiographical memory, and bilingualism and autobiographical memory.

How are your personal problems related to larger issues in society and the world? In what ways do global economic and political shifts affect your personal trajectory as a college student in the United States? In this course, you will come to understand sociology as a unique set of tools with which to interpret your relationship to a broader sociopolitical landscape. By integrating classic readings in the discipline of sociology with the principles of global political economy, we will analyze and contextualize a range of social, economic, and political phenomena at the scales of the global, the national, the local, and the individual.

A survey of the origins of sociology through the works of the classical founders of the discipline. Focused attention is given to the writings of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, with emphasis on learning to read and interpret primary texts. Students will understand foundational sociological concepts as used by classical theorists and will also apply these concepts to understand contemporary social life. Students will also explore the development of the canon of classical sociological theory with special emphasis on the place of women and African Americans in the history of that canon.

Social Problems
1
This course investigates why certain problems become matters of significant public and policymaking concern while others do not. We do not focus on a predefined list of social problems but rather on the process by which some issues capture more attention than others. Our discussions analyze the actions of those institutions involved either in calling public attention to or distracting public attention away from particular problems in our society. This focus enables students to acquire a perspective toward social problems that they are unlikely to gain from the many other forums where people discuss social problems, such as journalism or politics.

Global Health and Social Epidemiology
1
Concerns about the health of communities date back to antiquity. Social epidemiology is the study of the incidence and distribution of disease among populations. This course offers historical, sociological, and ethical perspectives on the uses of epidemiology as it emerged from an age defined principally by infectious disease to one of chronic illness. What are the social and collective responses to pandemics, real and imagined? Case studies address in particular global public health issues, including smoking, nutrition, AIDS, mad cow disease, and influenza, among others. Both governmental and nongovernmental approaches to health, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, are considered. Special attention is given to disparities in health care, a core sociological focus.

This seminar will focus upon children as both objects and subjects within societies. Beginning with consideration of the social construction of childhood, the course will examine the images, ideas, and expectations that constitute childhoods in various historical and cultural contexts. We will also consider the roles of children as social actors who contribute to and construct social worlds of their own. Specific topics to be covered include the historical development of childhood as a distinct phase of life, children’s peer cultures, children and work, children’s use of public spaces, and the effects of consumer culture upon children. Considerable attention will be given to the dynamics of the social institutions most directly affecting childhood today: the family, education, and the state.

First-Year Seminar: Learning Language through Culture, Learning Culture through Language
1
This course is for students who have learned Spanish primarily through an immersion experience abroad or at home. Participants in the course will have the opportunity to improve their written and oral Spanish language through the examination of cultural assumptions and values. Content is based on a variety of topics such as legends, differing historical perspectives, religious traditions, family values, and others. The review of language structures and grammar will emerge from students’ language levels, needs, and interests. Participants will read novels, short stories, plays, essays, and articles. They will listen to music and examine videos illustrating experiences of Spanish language learners in the United States and abroad. By the end of the semester, students will gain an understanding of how their culture influences their language learning and how their language learning affects their perspective of Latino/Hispanic culture. The course will be conducted exclusively in Spanish. At the end of the course, students will be advised about placement into further Spanish courses, based on their level of fluency.

Japanese Writers Explore Their World

Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
1
Introduction to the interdisciplinary field of women's and gender studies with an emphasis on an understanding of the "common differences" that both unite and divide women. Beginning with an examination of how womanhood has been represented in myths, ads, and popular culture, the course explores how gender inequalities have been both explained and critiqued. The cultural meaning given to gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality will be studied. This course also exposes some of the critiques made by women's studies' scholars of the traditional academic disciplines and the new intellectual terrain currently being mapped.

Introduction to Reproductive Issues: Culture and Politics
1
This course focuses on the politics of reproduction and examines the inextricability of reproduction from culture and power relations. Reproductive debates are never only about reproduction and health. They serve as proxies for fundamental questions about citizenship, national and religious identities, gender, class, race and sexuality. This course explores reproduction in cross-cultural contexts, attending to the social, ethical and policy implications of pregnancy, parenthood, and reproductive technologies. It is divided into three sections: frames and contexts, reproductive issues and debates, and women’s agency, social movements and global policy. Readings will problematize the multiple dimensions of reproductive politics and the social hierarchies that are produced, resisted, and transformed in the practice of reproductive lives.

Asian American Women in Film
1
This course will serve as an introduction to representations of Asian/American women in film beginning with silent classics and ending with contemporary social media.  In the first half of the course, we examine the legacy of Orientalism, the politics of interracial romance, the phenomenon of "yellow face", and the different constructions of Asian American femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. In the second half of the course, we look at "Asian American cinema" where our focus will be on contemporary works, drawing upon critical materials from film theory, feminist studies, Asian American studies, history, and cultural studies.

Gendering the Bronze Screen: Representations of Chicanas/Latinas in Film
1
The history of Chican@s and Latin@s on the big screen is a long and complicated one. To understand the changes that have occurred in the representation of Chican@s/Latin@s, this course proposes an analysis of films that traces various stereotypes to examine how those images have been perpetuated, altered, and ultimately resisted. From the Anglicizing of names to the erasure of racial backgrounds, the ways in which Chican@s and Latin@s are represented has been contingent on ideologies of race, gender, class, and sexuality. We will be examining how films have typecast Chicanas/Latinas as criminals or as "exotic" based on their status as women of color, and how Chicano/Latino filmmakers continue the practice of casting Chicanas/Latinas solely as supporting characters to male protagonists.

Politics of Sexuality in a Transnational World
1
,Drawing upon theories of sexuality and transnational feminist scholarship, this course explores sexuality as a construct, implicated in the division and management of populations within transnational political realms. Using social science and humanities approaches to sexuality, we tackle questions that include the following:� How is sexuality integral to racial discourses, class formation, citizenship, and criminalization? How are disability and life optimization discourses, reproductive politics, and the management of life and death of different populations related to the regulation of sexuality? How do nationalism, colonialism, militarism, and capitalism deploy sexuality in different times? Why is sexuality important to the study of labor, immigration, refugee rights, tourism, and diasporas? Through studying ethnography, performance, literature, and film, this course will examine sociopolitical and cultural aspects of sexuality in a transnational context.

American Health-Care History in Gender, Race, and Class Perspective
1
Traditional American medical history has emphasized the march of science and the ideas of the "great doctors" in the progressive improvement in American medical care. In this course, we will look beyond just medical care to the social and economic factors that have shaped the development of the priorities, institutions, and personnel in the health-care system in the United States. We will ask how gender, race, and class have affected the kind of care developed, its differential delivery, and the problems and issues addressed.

We will look comparatively at Native American, African American, Chicana/Latina, Asian American, and Pacific Islander men and women in film, photography, performance, and installation art. The course examines both dominant historical modes of representation of cultural,in the United States, in colonial/postcolonial contexts, and at contemporary modes of oppositional self-representation as a form of cultural critique and at contemporary self-representations.

Seminar. Transnational Feminisms
1
This seminar is structured as a critical engagement with "global” and transnational feminism(s).  It starts with an examination of some key feminist concerns and debates—feminist epistemology, issues of representation, agency and subjectivity, capitalism, patriarchy, post-colonialism and nationalism, globalization, development, migration, and incarceration. With a grasp of these analytical tools and issues, we move on to examine the formation of transnational women's movements that have mobilized around women's human rights. In the last part of the course, we will see why and how "sex trafficking" has become the convergent point of feminist debates, and consider the policy implications these differences and politics are having on the lives of women around the world.

1
This seminar explores contemporary global/international health through a political economy perspective that extends the disease-oriented, biomedical model of global health through engagement with the social determinants of health including gender, income inequality, culture, and nationality. Absent a global health infrastructure, we devote particular attention to the influential role of the United States in shaping global health and disease. South-to South efforts to improve individual and community health are also studied. We examine these subjects primarily through close readings of texts, weekly writing, seminar discussion facilitated by students and faculty, and student research.

The Making of the Modern Self: Writing and Identity from the Middle Ages to the Present
1
What do we understand by the term "selfhood," and especially "the modern self?" Can, or should, we think of the "birth" of the "modern self" as having occurred in a specific historical period? If so, when? What techniques do writers use to bring that self into being and what influences-historical, cultural, philosophical, psychological, and linguistic-help to shape it? Are literature and writing primarily a means of self-expression or self-creation? This course will explore themes such as these through writing assignments focused on the close-reading of selections from some of the great works of world literature (Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Woolf) which contribute to the debate about the origins and development of the self and the notion of the individual. The course will culminate with a personal essay assignment, giving students the opportunity to express an aspect of their own selfhood in a new way.

Nonfiction Writing
1
The memoir has in the last generation or two assumed a leading position in American literary culture. It has achieved this position perhaps despite its origins in a once-disreputable genre: confessional autobiography. Augustine admits in his,,to having been a thief in his boyhood; Rousseau promises in his to tell the reader “even the most truly odious things about myself.” But perhaps the imperative to make the details of private life public particularly appeals to the sensibility of a democratic age. You no longer have to be famous or old to write a memoir. But you must transcend the merely personal. The business of the course is to become accomplished in a form as famous for its intrinsic perils as for its pleasures.
